## Description

Internet retail, also known as **e-commerce**, is the largest sector of the electronics industry, generating an estimated $29 trillion in 2019. E-commerce platforms like Shopify and WooCommerce provide a suite of services to businesses of all sizes. Due to their prevalence, understanding the fundamental architecture of these platforms will benefit me as a full-stack web developer.

My task is to build the back end for an e-commerce site by modifying starter code.

## Installation

Before you begin, be sure to download all of the dependencies using: **npm install**

Then you will need to create your database. The database can be found here: [schema.sql](./db/schema.sql)

Once the database is created, seed your data using: **npm run seed**

Finally, inside of your a .env file fill out your credentials. An template env file is provided here: [.env.EXAMPLE](./.env.EXAMPLE)

## Database Models

This database contains the following four models, including the requirements listed for each model:

- `Category`

  - `id`

    - Integer.

    - Doesn't allow null values.

    - Set as primary key.

    - Uses auto increment.

  - `category_name`

    - String.

    - Doesn't allow null values.

- `Product`

  - `id`

    - Integer.

    - Doesn't allow null values.

    - Set as primary key.

    - Uses auto increment.

  - `product_name`

    - String.

    - Doesn't allow null values.

  - `price`

    - Decimal.

    - Doesn't allow null values.

    - Validates that the value is a decimal.

  - `stock`

    - Integer.

    - Doesn't allow null values.

    - Set a default value of `10`.

    - Validates that the value is numeric.

  - `category_id`

    - Integer.

    - References the `Category` model's `id`.

- `Tag`

  - `id`

    - Integer.

    - Doesn't allow null values.

    - Set as primary key.

    - Uses auto increment.

  - `tag_name`

    - String.

- `ProductTag`

  - `id`

    - Integer.

    - Doesn't allow null values.

    - Set as primary key.

    - Uses auto increment.

  - `product_id`

    - Integer.

    - References the `Product` model's `id`.

  - `tag_id`

    - Integer.

    - References the `Tag` model's `id`.

## Associations

- `Product` belongs to `Category`, and `Category` has many `Product` models, as a category can have multiple products but a product can only belong to one category.

- `Product` belongs to many `Tag` models, and `Tag` belongs to many `Product` models. Allow products to have multiple tags and tags to have many products by using the `ProductTag` through model.

## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN a functional Express.js API
WHEN I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file
THEN I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize
WHEN I enter schema and seed commands
THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia Core for categories, products, or tags
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database
```
